## This should be small

Small pull requests are great and easy for me to understand and accept
Please try prefix every commits in the pull request with  [Arlo's git notation](https://github.com/RefactoringCombos/ArlosCommitNotation/blob/master/README.md)
| Prefix | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| e   | development enviroment only - not production|
| d   | documentation only|
| t   | tests only|
| R!! | Refactoring |
| B!! | Bug Fix |
| F!! | New Feature |

## But it's not small!

Then you should setup a remote pairing session with Llewellyn ( llewellyn.falco@gmail.com )
Usually the sessions are between 45-90 minutes.

assuming you still feel it is small, please include

## Description

A description of what the PR achieves.

## The solution

Outline the implementation.
Any tests that are affected.

## Notation

I prefer lots of very small commits prefixed with [Arlo's git notation](https://github.com/RefactoringCombos/ArlosCommitNotation/blob/master/README.md)
